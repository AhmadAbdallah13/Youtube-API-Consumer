# Youtube API Consumer
simple django project that calls and deals with the Youtube API. The project can calculate the length of a playlist, sort it by views, and get all the unsorted videos from your
personal channel. I used OAuth for authentication purposes. 
* In some few casses I came across some playlists that the API can't handle, I don't know why, if you know or figured it out please do tell me, thank you.
